Upsets happen, and they are called upsets not because people respond to them with cordial equanimity. BUT in 2025, in collaboration with MMM graphic design guru, Prof. Will Nickley, we present the Busted Bracketeers Bracket! While you can’t update any digital bracket submissions, you CAN enter a new busted bracketeer bracket at Pools by Round OR print out this bracket and starting with the Sweet Sixteen, pick a new champion to cheer & keep following the MMM action through to the end! Rally your fellow friends with busted brackets to form your own local club!</b></p>
